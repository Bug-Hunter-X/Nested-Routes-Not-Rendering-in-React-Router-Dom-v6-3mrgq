# React Router Dom v6 Nested Route Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with nested routes in React Router Dom v6.  The problem is that nested routes fail to render their components, even when the parent route renders correctly.  The solution provides a corrected implementation.

## Problem

The provided `bug.js` demonstrates a simple app with nested routes. Navigating to nested routes results in only the parent route's component being rendered; the nested component is missing.  This is unexpected behavior.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file presents a corrected version of the app, ensuring nested routes are rendered appropriately. This solution fixes the rendering problem.
